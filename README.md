Welcome to the Black-Scholes Options Pricing and Greeks Calculator! This  tool provides options pricing and Greeks calculations based on the Black-Scholes model. With interactive visualizations, this project is designed to simulate the understanding and analyzing option price movements and sensitivity.


The implementation is based on the Black-Scholes-Merton differential equation:
∂V/∂t + (1/2)σ²S²(∂²V/∂S²) + rS(∂V/∂S) - rV = 0

Key assumptions:
- Log-normal distribution of stock prices
- Constant risk-free rate and volatility
- European-style options
- Frictionless markets

### Greeks Analysis
Comprehensive implementation of first and second-order Greeks:
- Delta (Δ): First partial derivative with respect to underlying price
- Gamma (Γ): Second partial derivative with respect to underlying price
- Theta (Θ): Time decay measurement
- Vega (ν): Sensitivity to volatility changes
- Rho (ρ): Sensitivity to interest rate changes
